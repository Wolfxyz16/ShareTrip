# Share Trip

> #### **Warning!**
> This is not a real application. It is a kick-off project made by EHU students for Software Engineering class.

## About

ShareTrip is an open source carpooling application between users that aims to be simple and effective. It also focuses on users privacy not sharing the users data with 3rd party companies.

## Features

* Consult rides available in your zone
* Offer a new ride
* Book the ride which you are interested
* Check your ride status (date, seats, status...)
* Create an alert 
* Send messages between users so you can organize the trip

## How can (*must*) I contribute

First thing to be done is to clone the repository. Go to the directory where you want to clone this repository. IE ``~/IdeaProjects``. Then copy the ssh URL and paste the next command on your terminal

``git clone git@github.com:Wolfxyz16/ShareTrip.git``

In order to have a clean and organized working experience each member of Orquesta Guayacan would need to create a local branch in the repository. This can be done with the next command:

``git branch YOUR_NAME``

Remember to change your current branch with the next command:

``git checkout YOUR_NAME``

When the task is implemented just push it upstream to the repository. This should create a remote branch in the GitHub repository. Then a pull request should be requested.

With this method we will guarantee that the `main` branch will be always working and with the full features implemented.
